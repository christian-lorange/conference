                    Ken Robertson is a Secwepemc from the Neskonlith Indian Band located in the south-central part of British Columbia’s Rocky
                        Mountains. Raised in East Vancouver -“Canada’s poorest postal code”- in a way similar to many First Nations peoples, he had
                        challenges accessing services on the reserve. Ken moved to Toronto in his youth and held positions at the Tumivut Youth Shelter,
                        and later the Native Canadian Centre of Toronto. Shortly after the diagnosis of autism of two of his children, Ken began
                        advocating for autism parents when he ran in the 2014 municipal election for Toronto District School Board Trustee, placing
                        second. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    He is a current Board Member of Autism Ontario and successfully launched a House of Commons E-petition advocating
                        for services for First Nations families off-reserve. His continued goal is advocating for all autism parents, and addressing
                        the challenges each family faces.

            We Are All in this Together
        </h1>

          <section class="about" style="padding: 1%">
                <div class="about-body bodyFormat">
                <p>
                      My motivation is to discuss the challenges of First Nations children on reserves and the limited access services faced by
                        all Canadians but especially focusing on the systemic barriers that First Nations peoples face. The premise of my speech
                        is to reaffirm that we are all in this together and that we work together for a common goal. 

                </p>
                <p> 
                My motivation came after the second diagnosis of autism in my family with my daughter. As a father of four, my approach began with an awareness campaign
                        during the 2014 municipal election for Toronto District School Board Trustee. The success of placing second pushed me to
                        continue working towards my goal of advocacy. I decided to first create Four Directions Autism to focus on the need for the
                        Urban First Nations community and then later speaking with various Members of Parliament including Gary Anandasangaree and
                        my MP Julie Dzerowicz, I decided to do something more. 
                </p>
                <p>
                With the support of my family, we painstakingly reached out to as
                        many people as possible to reach the minimum 500 signatures we needed for a response. The government responded and now provincial
                        and federal partners are working toward a clear goal to aid parents. However, more needs to be done as children with autism
                        eventually become adults with autism.
