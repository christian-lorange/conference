## PhoneGap Day App Source Code

This is the source code for the PhoneGap Day app used at PhoneGap Day 2016 and available [here for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.phonegapday.sample).

It demonstrates the use of Ace to infuse native UI into an Ionic 2 app, and is a modification of the sample at https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-conference-app.

Please visit our [homepage](http://ace.run/) for more info!

**If you're deploying this from Visual Studio, be sure to first do an "ionic serve" from a command prompt, otherwise the Ionic content won't be found when you run the app.**
