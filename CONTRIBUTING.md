## Issue Contribution 

* An issue contribution must have a tracking approved issue in [Issues](https://github.com/adnathan/PhoneGapDay/issues). 
* Your PR should have a link to the issue that you are fixing. 

## Feature Contribution

Feature contributions are welcomed, but need to be approved by collaborators.

## Legal

You will need to complete a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Briefly, this agreement testifies that you are granting us permission to use the submitted change according to the terms of the project's license, and that the work being submitted is under appropriate copyright.

Please submit a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before submitting a pull request. You may visit https://cla.microsoft.com to sign digitally. Alternatively, download the agreement ([Microsoft Contribution License Agreement.docx](https://www.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=typescript&DownloadId=822190) or [Microsoft Contribution License Agreement.pdf](https://www.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=typescript&DownloadId=921298)), sign, scan, and email it back to <cla@microsoft.com>. Be sure to include your github user name along with the agreement. Once we have received the signed CLA, we'll review the request. 

## Sending a PR

Your pull request should: 

* Include a clear description of the change
* Be a child commit of a reasonably-recent commit in the **master** branch 
    * Requests need not be a single commit, but should be a linear sequence of commits (i.e. no merge commits in your PR)
* Have clear commit messages 
    * e.g. "Refactor feature XYZ", "Fix issue XYZ", "Add tests for issue XYZ"
* To avoid line ending issues, set `autocrlf = input` and `whitespace = cr-at-eol` in your git configuration
