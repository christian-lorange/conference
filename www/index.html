<h4>What is this?</h4>
<p>We developed this app out of our own need. FoCoMX is always a fun weekend but it can also be a bit overwhelming. So many bands! So little time! We built this app to help us get the most out of FoCoMX (one of the best weekends of the year). We have done our best to get an accurate list of bands and venues around town; you can filter the list be day, venue, band, and style as well as shows you want to see to your personal list.</p>
<h4>Is this an official app for FoCoMX?</h4>

                <p><p>Nope - It's a way to search and filter band and concert information for the 2018 FoCoMX music festival. For official information on the festival check out <a href="http://focomx.focoma.org/" target="_blank" title="main focomx page" style="color: black">FoCoMX.</a> <a href="http://www.focoma.org/" target="_blank" title="main focoma page" style="color: black;">The Fort Collins Music Association</a> does great work. We really encourage you to check them out, voluteer, and donate. Lets all do what we can to support the Fort Collins music scene.</p>
<h4>What's the catch? Why'd you put this together</h4>
<p>A couple reasons: First, we love music - simple as that.  Second, we had a lot of yard work to do around the house. It was either develop this app or pick weeds - you're welcome we decided to be "productive." Finally, we run a part time freelance consulting company in addition to our day jobs. We'd been meaning to develop a similar tool for some other projects and this was a good excuse to finally get it done.</p>

 <p>I wanted to call it FoCo Squirrel Music but turns out I have a really hard time spelling squirrel correctly.</p>

        <h3 class="artist">Rock-Pop</h3>
        <p class="artist">BONER is a band fronted by a classically trained cellist with a filthy mouth. They pastiche all genres of music with an offensive and sometimes political flare. With hits titled Nobody Loves Me 'till 3 in the Moring" and "Smile, You Werent Aborted" BONER will either leave you laughing or walking out the door shaking your head.</p>

        <p class="artist">From being awarded grand-prize winner in Swallow Hill's annual Young Songwriters Competition 2016 and releasing her first full length record in June of the same year, Loveland folk-blues singer-songwriter Maya Bennett is on the way to becoming a strong force in the booming, local music scene. Bennett first started playing at the age of 12 when she learned three chords of a song to perform for the first time at a talent show at the historic Rialto Theater in Loveland. The rush of performing was addictive and intoxicating and lead to what has become Bennett's powerful stage presence and her emotive and complex songwriting style. At the age of 17, Bennett has graduated high school early, moved to Denver, and has written hundreds of songs and plays weekly in breweries, coffeehouses and anything in between across Colorado. With a unique guitar style and strong, emotive vocals, Maya Bennett is not a show to miss.</p>

        <p class="artist">Meeting in the wild west town of Fort Collins, 5 hermits joined forces to become something greater than themselves. Fortune would have it that both singers and guitarists, Jerrell Mock and Gus Waneka, as well as bassist, Adam Hartman, would live together in house just down the street from keyboardist, Hans Schlierf, and dummer, Maxwell Tretter. The 5 would find that they had no friends other than themselves, gathering for warmth in the cold winters of 2015-2016. What would come in the spring of 2016 would be the blossoming of Hermit Commune; a weird, energetic, but mostly weird rock band with the desire to play for those other than their mothers. They have been found playing in the northern Colorado area at venues such as the Downtown Artery, <button onclick="openModal();currentSlide(388)">Hodi's Half Note</button>, the Swing Station, and the Hi-Dive. Only the bassist bites (dammit, Adam), so dont be afraid to reach out!</p>

        <p class="artist">Riley Ann defies the expectations of a female folk musician. As a one-woman band, she conveys the energy and dynamic sound of a full band, towing the line of grit and refinement through her music. Elements of The Black Keys, Led Zeppelin, and Hozier are blended with a modern take on old time, creating a sound that's truly her own. As stated by one of her musical colleagues, She'd charge hell with a bucket of water."</p>

        <p class="artist">jinnjinni is an American indie folk duo comprised of singer/songwriter Josh Martin (guitar) and Liz Gaylor (5-string violin). They met at a party in fall 2016 when Liz joined Josh for an impromptu hearthside performance. Sensing magic, Josh asked Liz to join him in his newly forming band (Mirror Fields, psychedelia pop 5-piece). The two soon saw a congruence in musical tastes and quickly fell into a musical writing relationship that took on a life of its own. An initial few songs written in the spring of 2017 demanded their own project and jinnjinni (named for the muse who possesses you, compels you to create) was born. The writing continued through the summer and fall, and the 8 tracks that comprise jinnjinni's debut album were self recorded in their studio apartment over the winter (release April 4th, 2018).</p>

        <p class="artist">Anthony Armstrong (Headliner) has made a big splash on the local comedy scene since moving to Denver from Chicago a few years ago. For three years, he's been running showcases and headlining all over Colorado, including a recent televised appearance on the FoCo Underground Comedy showcase. With his unique stories, absurd exaggerations and one-of-a-kind out look on life, this up and coming comedian is sure to keep you laughing out loud. Nate Brown (Host) is a comedian born and raised in Colorado (Greeley specifically, which he's only a little bit sad about). He has performed all over the state as well as Wyoming and Texas, opened for comedy legend Todd Barry, advanced in the competitive Denver Comedy Works New Faces contest, and runs or co-runs shows at Hodi's Half-Note, Maxline Brewing and <button onclick="openModal();currentSlide(383)">Elliot's Martini Bar</button>. He wows audiences with his deadpan delivery, self-deprecation, and penchant for breaking the fourth wall (I actually wrote this bio. Who uses 'wow' as a verb, by the way? Ugh. Gross.)</p>

We found ourselves in the woods writing music from morning to night - nothing but music. No rules - no preconceived ideas. We wanted to go about things with a little more purity in mind. You'll hear many of these songs as we hit the road again this Spring. We are on to something - gonna follow it to the next scene.</p>

Originating in suburban Philadelphia, MISCOMUNICADO found their home in Colorado and developed a sound they call Future Classic Rock. Thriving off of an energetic crowd, paired with live visuals from skEYEfi, they never play the same set twice. MISCOMUNICADO is an experience that everyone needs to see to understand.</p>

Punk rock changed my life. I started writing songs that simply didnt fit into a punk format, so I started a solo project. I released my first EP called Catastrophizer just this year! I had my sister (graphic designer in Austin) do the artwork. I recorded 4 songs in Chicago at Atlas Studios. I played guitars, bass, percussion and vocals by myself. I'm very proud of the sound. And proud of myself for branching out from the full band thing.</p>

        <p class="artist">The Fort Collins-based, blues-fusion band Musketeer Gripweed simply explodes onstage with the energy and fervor of a revival preacher out to save a filthy sinner's soul.

With a passion influenced by modern and classic rock n soul heroes, Musketeer Gripweed creates an extraordinarily powerful live energy, and the band's gasoline intense vibe manifests in spontaneous, uncontrollable dancing and a compulsion to stand up, run to the stage and testify.</p>

        <p class="artist">King Eddie is the VR-Art Rock project from Jay Mars. The Denver band's new album, Holographic Universe, released Dec. 17, uses Virtual Reality as a metaphor for self-delusion. Facing a grave family illness immediately after the birth of his daughter, Jay navigates this duality through a sort of zen futurism to ask: if reality is maya, or illusion, may we create our own hologram?</p>

        <p class="artist">New Ben Franklins have always been about sonicness... if that's a word, and I dont think it is. Since the band's formation in 1992 they have always been about making some noise, whether playing full-blown, distorted rock-and-roll freak outs or more traditional country-inspired songs.In 2012, the band released their epic full length CD, [peter gabriel]. The album honestly showcased the range of musical styles that the band incorporates, as well as the fury with which they play. In the fall of 2015, the Franklins released 2 new CDs, entitled Something Old Something New and Something Borrowed Something Blue. The former a collection of original compositions and the latter a collection of covers spanning the band's influences over the last 4 decades. In March, 2017, the band released its latest full-length recording, What Happens When Things Fall Apart, a collection of songs that hearkens back to the bands earlier days; songs filled with noise, sadness, longing, and love.Call it Americana. Call it noisy country. Call it alternative country... It doesnt matter to the Franklins, as long as it's a fair piece loud and a ton of fun.</p>

        <h3 class="artist">Bluegrass-Americana</h3>
        <p class="artist">The cover of King Cardinal's stellar debut album, 'Great Lakes,' depicts a man catapulting himself headlong into the unknown, trading safety and security for adventure and excitement as he leaps over a protective railing. If the record is any indication, Mackey's own bold leaps have paid off in spades. Recorded over seven days at Texas' famed Sonic Ranch studio with GRAMMY-winning producer/ engineer Ted Young (Israel Nash, Banditos), 'Great Lakes' pushes the band's raw roots rock into lush, sonically daring territory with hints of cosmic country and delicate folk. Consisting primarily of live performances captured without embellishment or ornamentation, the album is direct, raw, and loose, with a palpable sense of camaraderie and musical kinship that showcases the five-piece group's exceptional musicianship and the powerful emotional depth of the vocal interplay between Mackey and fellow singer Texanna Dennie.</p>

        <h3 class="artist">Rock-Pop</h3>
        <p class="artist">Like all of the great rock and roll trios in history, Serpentfoot manage to create tunes that seem so much bigger and grander than what you would think just three people are capable of. Marrying heavy and probably drug induced aural kilos of psych-rock a la the Brian Jonestown Massacre and the artsy proto-punk sneer of bands like Television and the Sonics is already a recipe for beautiful disaster. Easily. But the foot doesnt stop there; they then decide to add heapin helpins of noodly 60's era surf and garage rock into the cake they're baking, turning the whole mess of a into a new album and band that is so damn good you'll need the recipe." -Pulp Magazine</p>

        <h3 class="artist">Indie-Alternative</h3>
        <p class="artist">All long-time musicians and songwriters, the members of Glass Cases began creating music as a group in 2016, resulting in their 16-track debut album (released September 2017). The self-titled album has an overall darker sound, but it is balanced with softer and happier melodies. Glass Cases formed with the idea that emotions and thoughts could be instilled in songs, much like the concept of glass cases" in the novel The Catcher in the Rye. The song styles are mostly of two types: ukulele and bass driven, and guitar driven (both with supporting piano and synth). They combine the soulful elements of Americana artists such as The Lumineers and The Avett Brothers with the darker and heavier elements found in alternative bands like Twenty One Pilots and The Airborne Toxic Event. They are continually creating music and refining their best sound, and will record their second album throughout 2018.</p>

        <p class="artist">A staple in the Fort Collins music scene from 2000-2010, DJ Juggernaut has been lurking in the background, simmering and waiting for just the right time to emerge and show the locals what strange sounds can come from raw emotion, and a heart beat that is bumping along at 124 BPM. The strange sounds include everything from live Jim Morrison chants, to Miles Davis trumpet hints, to electronic house music, all compiled and mixed for your sonic delight! Juggernauts' sound is best heard on a big system, with huge rolling basslines and crisp high hats throughout. Often said to be the best opening DJ in town, Juggernaut has an uncanny ability to take the opening-vibe and pick it up, mutate it, and turn it into a stomping angry robot monster before your ears. Take a trip back to memory lane and glimpse into the future at the same time.</p>

        <h2 class="artist">The Patti Fiasco</h2>
        <h3 class="artist">Bluegrass-Americana</h3>
        <p class="artist">Jet-fueled by powerhouse front woman Alysia Kraft, The Patti Fiasco rides the edge of emotional extreme, delivering a brash yet fiercely soulful brand of rock and roll with a heavy dose of rockabilly, blues, and ballad. At times raw and volatile, and at others, sweet and lilting, the band fuses a hard-rock swagger with the two-step of its Wyoming roots. It's the attitude of Joan Jett with a Steve Earle twang, the soul and slide of Bonnie Raitt, Black-Keys-style dirty blues-rock, and the lilting edginess of Shovels and Rope.Kraft's unrelenting energy, inspired songwriting, and vocals as pure and clean as they are powerful (Westword) earned her FoCoMA's 2013 Best Front Person award. The dobro, handmade and electrified--literally--by band member and 2007 RockyGrass dobro competition winner Ansel Foxley, builds the band's signature blend of rock, country, and Americana. Lead guitarist Dee Tyler's riffs range from gritty and driving to pensive and melodic, and his backing vocals add warmth to Kraft's pointed lyrics. On bass, Niles Mischke anchors the sound with solid, feel-good grooves, delivering an irresistible dance-floor appeal. Formidable drummer/percussionist Peter Knudsons smart yet gut-driven rhythms drive the group with a primal energy tempered by subtle sophistication.Conceived at a Wyoming open mic in 2008, The Patti Fiasco quickly earned wide critical acclaim, a devout fan base spanning the West and Midwest, and radio play across the nation. The band has shared the stage with renowned acts Big Head Todd and the Monsters, The Black Lillies, Ben Harper and Charlie Musselwhite, Justin Townes Earle, Great American Taxi, Cracker, Greensky Bluegrass, The Futurebirds, Born in the Flood, Lukas Nelson and the Promise of the Real, and Grammy-nominated Cajun band Feufollet. Their 2013 release, Small Town Lights, has garnered multiple accolades, including Wyoming Public Radio's Best Regional Album award, FoCoMA's Best Album award, and high positioning on the Colorado charts. It finished in the top 10 most-played Colorado records of 2013. The single of the same name received national radio play and was featured in the film Whensday. Nobody's Girl, from the band's self-titled 2011 debut, was that year's top-spun song in Colorado. The Patti Fiasco has participated in a variety of renowned showcases, including Lafayette Louisiana Downtown Alive and two appearances at SXSW, where they were backed by Colorado music powerhouse SpokesBUZZ. The WYOmericana Caravan tour, which the New York Times covered in a full-page spread, featured The Patti Fiasco in 19 shows across five states.</p>

        <h3 class="artist">Acoustic-Folk</h3>
        <p class="artist">Roots Rock Singer-Songwriter Erik Lunde was raised in Mapleton, Wisconsin, a nowhere town of about 150 people and 2,000 cows. His parents were Norwegian Hippie Lutherans gone Southern Baptist, subsequently his earliest exposure to music was old protestant hymns, spirituals, bluegrass and gospel, as well as the Simon and Garfunkel, Elton John, and Bob Dylan records his parents hid in the closet. As a kid he loved both the Beatles and the Stones and refused to choose which was better. His greatest musical memory as a child was listening to Queens We Will Rock You" on a little green transistor radio as he hid in the bathroom in the dark to hide from the wrath of the Lord and his devout relatives. He ran West to California a week after his high school graduation and came under the influence of Jim Morrison, Carlos Castaneda, Walt Whitman, and Jack Kerouac. He has been wandering and writing songs ever since. Sometimes when he is singing he thinks he is an old black woman, but the sound never comes out that way. He currently lives and plays in Fort Collins Colorado with his new band the Born Again Sinners. They are coming soon to a venue near you...</p>

But through the years he has not allowed himself to be pigeon-holed to just one genre of music or allow himself to be just a jukebox dj, but his goal is to be the soundtrack to the next generation and celebration of life in general, be it hip hop, dance, techno or abstract sounds; Having played all over Colorado and Wyoming as well, he seeks to continue to develop as a musician and dj, but also as a person with passion; and he hopes to echo that sentiment into the future.</p>

        <p class="artist">Listening to Slow Caves, one is reminded that being sonically interesting doesnt mean that a band must sacrifice having old fashioned hooks or pop sensibilities. Danish born brothers, Jakob and Oliver Mueller, provide the vocal and guitar backdrop for Slow Caves, a band (rounded out by childhood friends David Dugan - guitar/bass, and Jackson Lamperes drums) who offer a relaxed and surf-y update on 80's synth, 90's jangle, and early aught's indie rock. Formed in Ft. Collins, CO in 2014, Slow Caves quickly gained a reputation as a must-see local attraction. Soon the band was making an impression in Denver's vibrant music scene, earning slots at tastemaker clubs such as The Hi Dive and Lost Lake Lounge. In 2015, the band showcased their music at SXSW in Austin and CMJ in New York. Then in late 2016, the band signed with Cincinnati-based Old Flame Records (Cloud Nothings, Dead Confederate), performed at Boise's lauded, Treefort Festival and Austins' SXSW (March 2017), and released their Old Flame debut (Desert Minded-EP) on March 10, 2017. Since the release, the band has been touring all over North America and opened for bands such as DIIV, Cold War Kids, White Reaper, St. Lucia, Rooney, Cake and more.</p>

They enjoyed themselves so much that they continued to meet once a week, calling themselves The Triple Trio and performing as opportunities arose. As membership shifted over the years, resulting in a group that rarely consisted of exactly nine members, the name was changed to Take Note. The current group consists of 10-12 women who hail from Longmont, Frederick/Firestone, Lafayette, Berthoud, and Fort Collins. All are busy moms, connected by their faith and their love of singing and performing. Nearly half have degrees in music and currently teach private lessons. During the school year, they meet once a week to laugh, rehearse a bit, and laugh some more. They enjoy exploring highly challenging literature in a wide variety of styles, which they perform at events throughout northern Colorado. Above all, they seek to share with their audiences the joy they find through music.</p>

        <h3 class="artist">Bluegrass-Americana</h3>
        <p class="artist">Originally inspired by bands like the Beatles, Beach Boys and Byrds, Paul Honeycutt got a cheap electric guitar and a Bob Dylan songbook at a young age and began to figure out chords and strumming patterns. Over the years he's played everything from Louisiana music, country rock, reggae, jam band and Celtic music along with good ol' rock n roll. Settling in Colorado he has played with Lalla Rookh, The Swamp Things, Tuatha, The 4:20 Special String Band and now The Colorado Green Band. Growing up in a musical household (his father is a jazz pianist and his mother a music educator) Tom Surace took up bass after a bout with drums. He's played everything from country club jazz to heavy metal. He first met Paul playing in a band called The Bass Brothers and after living in Boston and Marin County, California he returned to Colorado. As luck would have it, he rejoined Paul in the 4:20 Special String Band and now in The Colorado Green Band. Paul and Tom discovered drummer Deb Bryant in a You Tube video linked from a Craigslist ad. After an audition they knew they'd found their drummer. Deb grew up in New York and learned to play the drums sneaking time on her cousins kit. After raising a family, she got inspired to play again. She's played rockabilly, blues and most styles of rock. The newest member of the band is pedal steel guitarist Phil Broste. A recent transplant from Southern California, Phil's influences include Tom Petty, Ryan Adams and Richard Thompson. While most people associate the pedal steel with country music, Phil's roots run deep and his playing takes the instrument to some unexpected places. Together they play diverse good time music with a groove delighting audiences around Northern Colorado for over five years.</p>

        <h3 class="artist">Cover-Tribute</h3>
        <p class="artist">The Dead Jam House Band was founded in January of 2012 when Fort Collins music scene veteran, Dan Loiz was asked to host a Grateful Dead themed open jam at a small venue by a friend and local business owner. Co-founder, Graham Miller joined the band at this time. The jam became successful, consisting partially of prepared and practiced sets by the House Band, as well as open jam sessions where other like-minded musicians could bring their instruments and perform together. Over time the attendance for this event grew, but the venue eventually had to close. At that time, Loiz was contacting by the booking agent for Avogadro's Number and asked to bring the event there. The first Dead Jam at Avogadro's was in September of 2013. Once at Avogadro's, the attendance nearly tripled. Ever since, Dead Jam's success has allowed it to survive as a monthly event.</p>

Known only to emerge to feed or mate. Ginger Whale is the musical fusion of Matt Mahern (of Motorhome and Constitution) and Jason Downing (front man of the local favorite Musketeer Gripweed). Bringing their fiery leo manes, clever lyrics, and amazing vocals and guitar skills to the stage, these two put on an acoustic show like you've never seen.The band name is half obvious. Ginger is because they both have red hair. Whale stems from the sounds the audience makes instead of clapping. It's kind of like uuuuhhhhhhhhhhhrrrrrruuuuaaa! Or something like that. We're basically just two guitars and whatever else you can make noise with, the Rev said. We have a lot of good skills. It's easy for both of us. He plays I sing, I play he sings. Fans can expect all the mystique of a Chriss Angel show without all of the make up.</p>

        <p class="artist">Described as one of the best acoustic pickers on the scene today, Cary Morin brings together the great musical traditions of America and beyond like no other. With deft fingerstyle guitar and vocals that alternately convey melodic elation and gritty world-weariness, Morin crafts an inimitable style often characterized as acoustic Native Americana with qualities of blues, bluegrass, jazz, jam, reggae, and dance.</p>

        <h3 class="artist">Rock-Pop</h3>
        <p class="artist">ETHAN GRIGGS + SONDER ENSEMBLE is a bright, fresh power trio (in its current form) coming down from a Mile High in Denver. Focusing the energy of psychedelic rock bands like the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Tame Impala and fusing it with the surrealistic song craft of Bob Dylan, R.E.M. and Bon Iver, the group is starting to hash out a name for itself in the Denver music scene. As a trio, they provide an interesting alternative to the full-scale lush arrangements on Griggs' recorded work, like his 2016 Transient EP. Griggs' songwriting has been praised by the likes of Todd Rundgren (who he's opened for), Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic, and Colorado's own music statesman Chris Daniels. A group that celebrates grouped individuality, Ethan Griggs + Sonder Ensemble look forward to turning on your mind.</p>

        <p class="artist">The very first evening that the core three of us (Kurt Bauer, Steve Gordon, &amp; David Mead) met there were three ideological questions asked.: 1~What is indeterminacy? 2~What is ambient? and 3~What is music? We've spent the last three years in continual redefinition of these principles.. ANIMAL/object is an ever evolving project in every way and no two shows are alike. We spend time apart building new instruments to bring to the table and ask about new ideas with each new opportunity. We strive to create a truly moving and unexpected direction with live shows and present a new awareness within hearing and even cooperating with music in the live venue. We've had the great pleasure of playing with a litany of notable local and international touring improvisors and have gleaned many new ideas from sharing with those that share our creative passion.</p>

        <p class="artist">We are the 10¢ Stranger and we call Laramie WY home. As a way to survive the windy WY winters we all love, we created 10¢ Stranger. This project quickly became a social club for friendship and creativity. Our music is influenced by genres as vast and varied as our life experiences. Bob Lefevre (Bondurant, Tie Hack) is our primary songwriter. His ability to weave intricate stories into simple phrases allows us to create songs that are relevant, timeless, clever and necessary. With the versatile playing of Jay Shogren (J Shogren Shanghaii'd), Jackson Clarendon (Libby Creek Original), and Shawn Hess (Tie Hack, Elktongue), coupled with the vocals of Laniece Schleicher (Mama Lenny and the Remedy) and Elianna Paninos, we've found a sound uniquely our own. We draw on decades of collective musical experience to provide an entertaining and energetic show. Whether you're in the mood to stomp your feet or spin in circles, we've got something for everyone.</p>

        <p class="artist">The Lollygags are not Garage Rock, they are Garage Rock 'n Roll. They are not a jam band, but they are a band who likes to jam. The Lollygags are not a cover band, but have been known to cover their favorite tunes. Their music has been described as being like if HÃ¼sker DÃ¼ found themselves in a rumble with the Cheap Trick or if the Kinks had come of age in the early 1990s. With influences from the 50s right up until today and wielding a passion for all flavors of rock 'n roll, The Lollygags have a sound which will always be in style. Founded by Denver native and lifelong lollygagger Jonathan Snyder, the Lollygags have been bringing pop hooks and crisp riffs to the Rocky Mountain Region since 2011. They have had the pleasure to have shared the stage with the likes of Redd Kross, the Supersuckers, Imperial Teen, Gringo Star, and Nashville's Simo. Both the Lollygags' 2017 sophomore self-titled EP as well as 2014' 'People I Know' are now available for download and streaming!</p>

        <h3 class="artist">Rock-Pop</h3>
        <p class="artist">With an edge of daring and a tinge of heartbreak, Lindsey O'Brien Band (LOB)'s singular brand of soulful, rock &amp; roll has been a staple of the Colorado music scene for more than 10 years.Their sound unites the drive of rock, the depth of folk, and the groove of soul--and throws in the get-up-and-dance of funk, a touch of jazz sophistication, and just enough pop to party to. It's a full, layered sound that achieves no small feat: crowds both want to shout along and hear every word close--which is why they keep coming back for more.</p>

        <h3 class="artist">Blues-Jazz</h3>
        <p class="artist">Formed in 2005 from the remenants of several key jazz and funk bands in Denver, Bigga Digga forged a path for the next half decade, putting more than a little sause and swagger into the smooth jazz scene at the time. Propelled by the rhythm sections pocket-groove gravity well, irreverant harmony and melody ran counter-culture raids on a genre dominated by proper ladies and gentlemen. Clothed in familiar sounding intrumentation, Bigga Digga spliced the DNA of multiple music styles like mad scientists who never bothered to ask if they should, and created their own musical organisms, however ugly, but completly adapted to thrive on the meek. Having gorged itself on an increasingly divergent music scene in Denver, Bigga Digga led itself to pasture, where it would stud countless other offspring in other towns across the Front Range.Now, after an eight year hibernation, and in celebration of FoCoMX X, Bigga Digga will once again hunt down proper jazz and tear it to shreads.</p>

        <h3 class="artist">Rock-Pop</h3>
        <p class="artist">The Velveteers are an American Rock outfit from Boulder, Colorado that is the epiphany of punk with the aggressive sound and grungy wisdom that transcends through the Siren like power of 19 year old Demi Demitro's (frontwomen/lead guitar) voice. Through the distorted guitar riffs and thunderous drums they lure their audience with vibes that come right out of a classic horror flick. When The Velveteers released their debut single called Death Hex. Following the release of their first single/ music video they headed out on their very first tour to support Deap Vally on numerous dates across the UK. Since then The Velveteers released their Debut EP which came out on February 7th 2018 and have been touring all across the USA with plans to make it back to Europe later in the year.</p>

        <h3 class="artist">Indie-Alternative</h3>
        <p class="artist">Staci Foster, Tobias Bank (Von Stomper), and Alysia Kraft (Patti Fiasco) are on the same wavelength of intentionality. Catharsis is the point of the songs but the tools to get there vary. With Bank on drums, Foster swapping between guitar, harmonica, and banjo, and Kraft playing electric guitar, they're in their element with raw, harmony-driven, stripped-down performances that nod to icons Neil Young and Lucinda Williams. There is spirituality in the country backdrops they write from and a deep reverence for the landscapes that raised them.Recorded at GPM Studio in Fort Collins and co-produced by Tallgrass, their debut album contains six- stick-to-heart tracks that earned them 2016 nominations for Wyoming Public Radio and the Colorado Playlists' Best Albums of the Year. Culture Trip named them to the female edition of 50 Musicians You Need to Know from Each State. In their first year as a band, they've shared stages with Lydia Loveless, Colin Hay, Gil Landry (Old Crow Medicine Show), and will Share a stage with Big Thief this spring.</p>

Featuring vocalist/guitarist Caleb McFadden, bassist/keyboardist Justin Daggett, and percussionist/producer Mike Davis, the trio spent the majority of fall 2016 working on The Gutshalls, a five-song EP ranging from gritty, teeth-grinding punk to atmospheric, trapped-in-the-head soundscapes. On March 5th, 2017, Chess at Breakfast debuted the record on Koncept Jewel Entertainment.Their first full-length album will drop in spring of 2018.</p>

        <p class="artist">Plume Varia is the dreampop/indie-pop project of husband and wife, Shon and Cherie Cobbs. Denver transplants originally from Minneapolis, Cherie and Shon are most comfortable when submerged within a great local music scene. Experienced musicians, writers and performers; they created this project as a way to merge together their deep and independent musical roots in a way that artistically represents both of their individual styles. Plume Varia's music is the balance of lonesome lilting melody and the promise of assured forward motion. Cherie's alluring and imaginative songwriting married with Shons pull to darker, brooding production creates a dense, refined and consuming sound. They have drawn comparisons to acts such as Beach House, The XX, Lana Del Ray, Portishead and Wye Oak. They've had the pleasure of opening for many National acts such as Peter Murphy, Dada, In The Valley Below, Avec Sans, Handsome Ghost, Jolie Holland, She Keeps Bees, Soko, Rogue Valley, Parellels and many more.</p>

        <h3 class="artist">Acoustic-Folk</h3>
        <p class="artist">2nd runners up in the UllrGrass Band Competition, and formed in late 2017 from a core group of experienced Front Range singers and pickers, Flatt Five is a new bluegrass and Americana band that calls the greater Denver area home. With a focus on original songwriting and strong three-part harmonies as well as hot picking, Flatt Five combines the diverse musical experiences of its members (which include stints in number of well-respected Colorado bands) to create a unique sound that evokes classic artists like Flatt &amp; Scruggs, Ralph Stanley, Blue Highway and Union Station, all in an entirely new context that reflects the landscape of their Colorado home. Look for Flatt Five to begin making its mark on the Colorado bluegrass scene and beyond in 2018.</p>

        <h3 class="artist">Bluegrass-Americana</h3>
        <p class="artist">Based in Fort Collins, Colorado, The Holler! presents a funky progressive bluegrass sound, rock n roll personality and bombastic vocals delivered with mountaintop exclamation. In the canyons of influence, with child-like eyes and wonder, these tone chasers relentlessly explore their roots in acoustic music and dramatic lyricism. This band's bottomless cup of original repertoire is led by mandolin obsessed song-smith Michael Kirkpatrick, whose voice resonates with evangelical theatrics and gratitude. The Holler! just released their first album since 2011: Wildwood.17 years of sonic wanderlust has seen the band through many forms, employing sitar, keyboards, tuba, lap steel, accordion and world percussion into their evolving acoustic folk-rock format. Their repertoire artistically celebrates reverence for nature, the exploration of human consciousness, and their passion for festive community gatherings while echoing the Colorado landscape The Holler! calls home.-The group's songwriting is second-to-none</p>

        <h2 class="artist">Foxfeather</h2>
        <h3 class="artist">Bluegrass-Americana</h3>
        <p class="artist">Foxfeather is a sultry alt-americana band founded in Boulder, CO in 2013. Beginning with a lyrical base, and bolstered by strong blues-rock instrumentals, Foxfeather's unique sound captivates their audience. The band consists of Carly Ricks Smith (lead vocals), Laura Paige Stratton (acoustic/electric guitars, keys, vocals), Patrick Coleman (upright/electric bass, violin), Ben Batchelor (drums and percussion), and Ian Hendrick (electric guitar). Foxfeather is a local staple in the Colorado Front Range, and also tours nationally. The band released their EP, Foul Moon, in 2014. In response to this release The Marquee stated that the group is overflowing with talent and Carly Ricks Smith has a spectacular voice which lies somewhere between the folky soprano of a young Joni Mitchell and the jazz-heavy range of Lake Street Dive's Rachel Price. It's powerful as well as delicate. Andy Eppler of The Prairie Scholars said it's sexy. It's original. These women have crafted something very special and instantly likeable on this album. The BoulderBeat reviewed Patrick Colemans presence on bass as one of the biggest treats of their performance, with a jazzy undertone that rightfully demanded its own attention. The band released their first full length, self titled album in October of 2016, which Rooster magazine described as time warping...it's an emotional ride into the forest of folk with low-hanging country branches slapping you in the face without apology... its got a good thing going" (Rooster Magazine).</p>

Combined with a synchronized light show, Post Paradise bring a rock edge and reverberating beat to an underlying indie classical vibe, best showcased by the punctuation of the cello, played by Amy Morgan. Fusing the depth and beauty of the cello with singer/guitarist Nick Duarte's signature vocals and edgy riffs, the two become the cornerstone of the quartet further enhanced by Ed Ziehm on drums and percussion, and Brian Zeiger on bass guitar.Together, the four create a sound all their own, with echoes of nineties alternative, modern indie poeticism, and classical music. Post Paradise is now a seasoned and recognized entity on the Colorado music scene. They are currently working on their new album for release in mid 2018!</p>

        <h3 class="artist">Singer-Songwriter</h3>
        <p class="artist">Americana-inspired singer songwriter Bethel Steele has toured from Portland, Maine to Austin, Texas slinging songs and sharing stories with listeners. Steele's career began in Boston, MA in 2008 and after releasing four projects there, B calls Fort Collins, Colorado home. Something of an amalgam of Lori McKenna, Ani DiFranco, Lucinda Williams and Neil Young, Bethel's sound is the combination of a smoky alto voice and a guitar playing style that ranges from percussive and driving to delicate and sweet. While exploring the intrinsic beauty in whiskey-soaked one night stands, the stories of thrill-seekers and the unrelenting passage of time, Steele draws the listener in with songs that are clearly intensely personal, but reveal themselves to be true for us all. You cannot help but be moved and perhaps changed a little for the better in listening to them. (Kelly Walker, Sundilla Radio Hour)</p>

        <h3 class="artist">Rock-Pop</h3>
        <p class="artist">Blake Brown is an American singer-songwriter from Denver, Colorado. After participating in many collaborative projects, he started Blake Brown &amp; The American Dust Choir in 2013. The idea was to have the flexibility of playing solo, but to also include a revolving cast of musician friends when they were able to join him. Part of the cast includes close friends and musicians of groups, The Fray, The Films, and Tennis. After 3 EPs, countless shows, and a debut full length to be released in March 2018, Brown has found mainstay players. His wife, Tiffany Brown and longtime friends Jason Legler, Adam Blake and Trent Nelson make up The American Dust Choir, creating a blend of indie-rock and Americana. Browns music is rooted in acoustic sounds, and characterized by his seemingly simple, yet complex melodies and heartfelt lyrics. Marked by a strangely captivating subtleness, Browns music and haunting stage presence leaves bystanders with something to think about and wanting more.</p>

        <h3 class="artist">Rock-Pop</h3>
        <p class="artist">With roots in both Ft. Collins and Denver, Colorado's Wire Faces has a sound that can only be described as bigger than the sum of its parts. Their music seethes with primal energy, chaos and melodic finesse. Front man and drummer Shane Zweygardt, guitarist Ian Haygood, and bassist Menyus Borocz stylistically blend elements of post-punk into their groove-focused, experimental rock n roll. This concoction is the result of the band's somewhat autonomous style of writing. Their affinity to not subscribe to a particular genre has allowed Wire Faces to stand apart from their peers, while strengthening the foundation of their creative center, improvisation.</p>

        <p class="artist">The Two Tracks are out of Wyoming and highlighted by a fantastic bluegrass cellist and a charismatic female lead vocalist performing an addictive, joyous romp of Americana. They have two critically acclaimed albums of original material that No Depression described as creating an instant connection...in truth there's not a single offering here that doesnt engage the listener practically from the get go...There is just enough twang in the music to make it country, and just enough rock to make it interesting. Lay the voices of Szewc and Huebner on top and it is a musical banana split of consequence." They've been making the rounds of the festival circuit including an appearance at 2017's Bohemian Nights NewWestFest, as well as festivals across Wyoming, Montana, and South Dakota. Their latest album Postcard Town, was produced by Will Kimbrough (Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell, Todd Snider), and recorded by Grammy winner Sean Sullivan (Sturgill Simpson) at the Butcher Shoppe Studio in Nashville, TN.</p>

        <h3 class="artist">Bluegrass-Americana</h3>
        <p class="artist">Grayson County Burn Ban is a Denver-based group fronted by Texas-native, Austen Grafa. While Austen grew up surrounded by the songwriting of Guy Clark, Jerry Jeff Walker, Terry Allen, and Robert Earl Keen, he would cruise around old dirt roads listening to Bright Eyes, Radiohead, and Third Eye Blind. It was not until ten years later, living in Colorado, writing songs of his own, did he realize how much of an unintended influence those country" artists had on his writing style. Then one summer day in 2014, as two Denver bands toured across the Southwest, a conversation was started about a new group; a group that was country...kind of, and rock-n-roll...kind of. Using <button onclick="openModal();currentSlide(391)">The Lyric</button>-driven songs that Austen had been working on with all the other skills and interests that each band member had to offer, Grayson County Burn Ban was formed. Three years later, their sound expands with the debut full length "Better Neighbor"; a 12 song smorgasbord of introspective lyrics and grab-a-buddy sing-a-longs. While each song compliments the next, their genre may be hard to categorize; but dont fret, because they've done it for you - Grayson County Burn Ban plays "campfire country rock" and they will be coming to a city near you.</p>

        <h3 class="artist">Rock-Pop</h3>
        <p class="artist">A blind and a sighted duo with a 600+ song repertoire. Blind Brian Collins (vocals, piano, drums, and synthesized bass) and sighted Sean Waters (vocals, guitars, and bass) offer a rare combination of instrumental musicianship and vocal harmony. Playing over 130 shows in the Colorado front range each year, the Seers have played wedding receptions in Rocky Mountain National Park and the Coors Field VIP lounge, private estates in Idaho to ranches in Northern California, country club pool-parties, Christmas parties, backyard barbecues, grass-roots festivals, breweries, dive-bars, lounges, steakhouses, farmers markets, and bowling alleys. As an electrified duo, Waters wails an electric guitar while Brian Collins, taking inspiration from Def Lepard's Rick Allen, plays the drum kit, saving his left hand for synth-bass and organ. As a \full band\ of two people, Collins' ambidextrous skills wow audiences. Add tight, gutsy vocal harmonies, and the electric duo sounds like a driving rock and blues trio perfect for bigger venues and festivals. As an acoustic duo of acoustic guitar and keyboard, the Seers' singing abilities really shine. Multiple managers and bar owners claim that the Seers are the best band they've had; the intimacy of an acoustic show showcases the Seers' crowd interaction and amazing repertoire. The Seers can perform, on request, any song from a 500+ song request list (that's 32 hours of music). The acoustic Seers duo is perfect for smaller rooms and restaurants. With their talents as original songwriters, Waters and Collins have forged semi-professional careers as musicians in the Colorado Front Range. After The Seers, their freshman full-length album in 2013, their sophomore effort, a year in the making, entitled Cellophane Eyes, was released on September 26th of 2014. More new music from The Seers is upcoming in 2015. Their 2013 album was funded, in part, from a successful crowd-funding campaign, which shows their grassroots support. The Seers are the perfect band for any event that cherishes the power of music, singing, harmony, and joy.</p>

        <h3 class="artist">Bluegrass-Americana</h3>
        <p class="artist">It's Matt Mahern and Constitution devil may care' ease that makes crowds kick off their shoes and let loose. But it's their warmth, honesty, and mastery of the Americana genre that pulls listeners in and keeps them there. Their sound draws from quintessential American traditions country, folk, and rock with a heavy dose of bluegrass to drive the point home. With the ability to entertain a late night crowd or a family-friendly daytime event, Constitution has charmed audiences at festivals such as FoCoMX, New West Fest, Taste of Fort Collins, Bark and Bluegrass Festival, and at the Mishawaka Amphitheater. Matt Mahern and Constitution formed in 2009. After the disbanding of the local favorite Motorhome, three of its members (Matt, Darren, and Ben) along with their friend and drummer (Pete) found a new musical home in Constitution. With Matt's songwriting, they entertained audiences as a four-piece acoustic ensemble. Two years later, they released their first album Wrestling with the Daylight, which was the top-playing album on KRFC Radio in November 2011. A few months down the road, the band slightly altered their sound when Pete stepped away and Ansel stepped in on dobro. In recent days, the band has morphed into a conglomeration of various local artists. The songs are the same but the instruments and the players may change from show-to-show. You could catch a six-piece band, a solo act or a four-piece acoustic set. Below is a running list of musicians you might find on stage with Matt. You might not know what players you'll see on stage but with Matt Mahern and Constitution, you can always expect a good old time.</p>

        <h3 class="artist">Electronic-DJ</h3>
        <p class="artist">Following the demise of the Dead Kennedys in the wake of the financial and emotional disaster that was their 1986 obscenity trial, vocalist and free-speech icon Jello Biafra launched a solo career, devoting some of his releases to spoken-word observations on American culture and politics and others to collaborative efforts with several bands. Biafra was born Eric Boucher in Boulder, Colorado, and began collecting odd records in high school. He moved to San Francisco and took his stage name from the war-ravaged African nation then called Biafra, appending the name of the popular dessert substance because he liked the way the two sounded together. Biafra formed the Dead Kennedys in 1978, and the band quickly gained a following thanks to their hyperdriven sonic assault and Biafra's nasal, declamatory (and often quite funny) political rantings. In 1979, a year before the Kennedys' influential debut Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables was released, Biafra ran for mayor of San Francisco on a bet; his platform included holding auctions for high-ranking city government positions, setting up a board of bribery to handle liquor licenses and building codes, banning automobiles in the city limits, forcing businessmen to dress in clown suits, and allowing vagrants legal access to empty buildings. (Voters apparently found the satire compelling enough to place Biafra fourth out of ten candidates.)</p>

        <p class="artist">The Leshen started as an experimental side project for members Myke Fedyk and Kirk Alberts. They were looking to step away from the traditional rock band architecture and experiment with new sonic textures and arrangements. Unhindered by the confines of standard pop music arrangements, ego and expectations the two have forged a crunchy, melodic, post-rock/metal sound. The intentional lack of vocals and band's use of visuals in live performances creates an immersive experience and encourages the listener to create their own story.</p>

        <p class="artist">ELCTRX loosely drives along styles of glitch-hop, electro, neuro-hop, experimental trap, and hip-hop to create an experience within its own. Sharing the stage with artists such as The Funk Hunters, Defunk, Phutureprimative, Luzcid, Terravita, Shlump, Krooked Drivers, Soulacybin, Dirt Monkey, Crizzly, Goldyloxx and Skydyed, ELCTRX can set the tone for any vibe. With a genre-less style approach to his performance, he provides an intricate and emotional journey to an auditory utopia. Pushing the limits of production with a healthy balance of metaphysics and engineering as the foundation that offers a new touch to classic and modern music alike.</p>
