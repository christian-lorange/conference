                <p>
                    As Canadian cities become increasingly culturally diverse, one size does not always fit all when it comes to supporting healthy
                    child development. Health care systems and providers need to respond to varied perspectives, values, and behaviors connected
                    to health and well-being. Failure to understand and manage social and cultural differences may have significant health
                    consequences for minority groups in particular.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    SAAAC’s inaugural conference Culture Counts - Culturally Responsive Autism Support in Research and Practices will engage with the timely issue of autism and demonstrate how to
                    provide effective ASD support to a rapidly changing population.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The event will provide you with a space to connect with families, researchers, health professionals, advocates and community
                    agencies to better understand ASD as it relates to minority communities and the challenges faced by underserved communities.

                        Elaine Gabovitch, parent of a young adult son with autism, was advised to “wait and see” back in 1997 when she questioned
                        her son’s developmental delays at the age of two. After hearing the same from other parents, she decided that public awareness
                        was the answer and has worked ever since to promote early identification and health equity. Ms. Gabovitch is currently the
                        Director of the Division for Children &amp; Youth for Special Health Needs at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.
                        Prior to her work at DPH- from 2005 until late 2016- she served as Family Faculty at the UMass Medical School-Eunice Kennedy
                        Shriver Center’s Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities Program (LEND) and University Center for Excellence
                        in Developmental Disabilities (UCEDD) and as an Instructor in the UMass Medical School Department of Family Medicine &amp;
                        Community Health. She continues to serve in these roles as adjunct faculty. From 2011-2016, she was the CDC’s Act Early Ambassador
                        to Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Act Early State Team Leader.

                    <p>
                        Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other developmental disorders (DD) from diverse cultural and linguistic
                        backgrounds are significantly less likely to be identified for evaluation and services and are also diagnosed at later ages
                        than children from English-speaking families. The reason for this may be that concepts of screening, early identification
                        and early intervention may be unfamiliar for families from diverse backgrounds. For many families, these concepts are culturally
                        bound and they may perceive that their children will be stigmatized in their communities by participating in these practices.
                        Recognizing the need for health equity in early identification of children with ASD/DDs from culturally diverse backgrounds,
                        Elaine Gabovitch has led the development of the Considering Culture in Autism Screening Kit and Curriculum for pediatric
                        and early childhood professionals and the 1, 2, 3…Grow! cable television series for parents of young children, which is available
                        in seven languages. This presentation will share lessons learned from these projects, using video interviews of parents of
                        children with ASD across cultures to illustrate some of the key issues.

                        best teach about and learn from such encounters. He is also interested in studying how clinicians reflect on their day-to-
                        day practices, and how simulations can be used to support such reflection in the context of health profession education.

                        Dr. Stelios Georgiades is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences at McMaster
                        University. He is Founder and Co-Director of the McMaster Autism Research Team (MacART), Co-Founder of the Child Health Specialization
                        in the Bachelor of Health Sciences (BHSc.) Program, and a Core Scientist at the Offord Centre for Child Studies. Dr. Georgiades’
                        research investigates the heterogeneity in diagnostic profiles and developmental trajectories in autism. Within an integrated
                        model of research and practice, Dr. Georgiades’ work aims to inform the development of more precise and adaptive models of
                        care that meet the complex needs of those living with autism. Dr. Georgiades is the Principal Investigator of the Pediatric
                        Autism Research Collaborative – PARC Project at McMaster Children’s Hospital, the McMaster co-lead for the national Pathways
                        in ASD study, and a Co-Principal Investigator for the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental Disorders – POND Network. Dr.
                        Georgiades has served as an Expert Scientist appointed by the Federal Minister of Health on the Working Group for the Canadian
                        Autism Partnership and sits on the ASD Clinical Expert Committee of the Ontario Ministry of Children and Youth Services.

                    <p>
                        Dr. Georgiades will discuss his team’s research on the developmental trajectories of children with ASD. He will introduce
                        the concept of ‘chronogeneity’ – heterogeneity in relation to the concept of time – and discuss how this concept can facilitate
                        communication and inquiry among researchers studying the longitudinal course of autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders.
                        He will also explore how socio- contextual factors are associated with diverse trajectories. Dr. Georgiades will then discuss
                        how interdisciplinary collaborations that integrate research, clinical practice, and policy may move us closer to more precise
                        and adaptive models of care for the children, youth, and families living with autism.

                    <p>
                        Autism affects over 50 million children worldwide. Research into the condition is increasingly international, presenting
                        opportunities and challenges towards a tangible impact, locally and globally. Dr. Elsabbagh will discuss key global themes
                        including the need to understand the underlying biology, diversity and variable impact across those affected, and the critical
                        role of supportive families and communities. Development of innovative models for research and services which consider diverse
                        communities will be beneficial to our own society and the rest of the world.

                        Ken Robertson is a Secwepemc from the Neskonlith Indian Band located in the south-central part of British Columbia’s Rocky
                        Mountains. Raised in East Vancouver -“Canada’s poorest postal code”- in a way similar to many First Nations peoples, he had
                        challenges accessing services on the reserve. Ken moved to Toronto in his youth and held positions at the Tumivut Youth Shelter,
                        and later the Native Canadian Centre of Toronto. Shortly after the diagnosis of autism of two of his children, Ken began
                        advocating for autism parents when he ran in the 2014 municipal election for Toronto District School Board Trustee, placing
                        second. He is a current Board Member of Autism Ontario and successfully launched a House of Commons E-petition advocating
                        for services for First Nations families off-reserve. His continued goal is advocating for all autism parents, and addressing
                        the challenges each family faces.

                    <p>
                        My motivation is to discuss the challenges of First Nations children on reserves and the limited access services faced by
                        all Canadians but especially focusing on the systemic barriers that First Nations peoples face. The premise of my speech
                        is to reaffirm that we are all in this together and that we work together for a common goal. My motivation came after the
                        second diagnosis of autism in my family with my daughter. As a father of four, my approach began with an awareness campaign
                        during the 2014 municipal election for Toronto District School Board Trustee. The success of placing second pushed me to
                        continue working towards my goal of advocacy. I decided to first create Four Directions Autism to focus on the need for the
                        Urban First Nations community and then later speaking with various Members of Parliament including Gary Anandasangaree and
                        my MP Julie Dzerowicz, I decided to do something more. With the support of my family, we painstakingly reached out to as
                        many people as possible to reach the minimum 500 signatures we needed for a response. The government responded and now provincial
                        and federal partners are working toward a clear goal to aid parents. However, more needs to be done as children with autism
                        eventually become adults with autism.
